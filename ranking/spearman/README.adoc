== Usage

This is based on:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient

but we extend it so that the top `n` predicted ranks are matched against the actual ranks even if an actual rank is not in the top `n`

=== List the available cells

----
$ python list_cells.py summary_predicted.all.tsv | column
CO-006  CO-039  CO-060  CO-118  CO-153  CO-173  CR-010  HN-045  HN-064  HN-158  HN-185  HN-244
CO-017  CO-042  CO-066  CO-119  CO-161  CO-174  CR-029  HN-049  HN-067  HN-161  HN-235  HN-252
CO-031  CO-045  CO-071  CO-120  CO-163  CO-175  CR-034  HN-051  HN-069  HN-179  HN-237  HN-264
CO-034  CO-049  CO-103  CO-152  CO-171  CR-007  HN-044  HN-052  HN-144  HN-184  HN-239
----

=== Run a single Spearman

See:

----
$ python do_spearman.py -h
----

E.g.,

----
$ python do_spearman.py summary_predicted.all.tsv CR-029 3
original dataframe length: 1269
mae:       3.667
spearman:  0.750
----

=== Run Spearman for all cells
